Built complete tile-based map system with collision detection (stone, tree, water obstacles), implemented smooth camera following system, created sprite animation system with frame cycling, developed 4-directional player movement with WASD controls, and implemented NPC AI system with WANDER and IDLE behaviors. The engine shows: tile map rendering with different terrain types, NPCs moving autonomously (wandering NPC moving from 500,400 to 495,396), player animations cycling through walk frames, and camera system working. All systems integrate perfectly and the engine builds/runs successfully."],"modified_files":["/home/eelfcar/2d-engine/src/main/java/engine/graphics/Tile.java","/home/eelfcar/2d-engine/src/main/java/engine/graphics/TileMap.java","/home/eelfcar/2d-engine/src/main/java/engine/graphics/Camera.java","/home/eelfcar/2d-engine/src/main/java/engine/ecs/AnimationComponent.java","/home/eelfcar/2d-engine/src/main/java/engine/ecs/AIComponent.java","/home/eelfcar/2d-engine/src/main/java/game/systems/MovementSystem.java","/home/eelfcar/2d-engine/src/main/java/game/systems/AnimationSystem.java","/home/eelfcar/2d-engine/src/main/java/game/systems/AISystem.java","/home/eelfcar/2d-engine/src/main/java/game/states/WorldGameState.java"],"id":"1763136614233"}
